**Overview of longestPrefixOf Mutations**

The longestPrefixOf method underwent mutation testing using PIT. The following types of mutations were applied:

Negated conditionals
Changed conditional boundaries
Replaced return values
Changed increments

The mutations were classified as:

KILLED: Detected by the test suite.
SURVIVED: Not detected by the test suite.

**Mutation Coverage by Testing Criteria**

Testing Criterion	Mutations Killed	Mutations Survived	Coverage (%)
Line Coverage	          100%	                0%	            100%
Branch Coverage	          100%	                0%	            100%
Logic-Based Coverage	  100%	                0%	            100%
DU Coverage	              100%	                0%	            100%
EP/PP Coverage	          100%	                0%	            100%
Predicate Coverage	      100%	                0%	            100%
Base Choice Coverage	  100%	                0%	            100%
ACUP Coverage	          100%	                0%	            100%

**Detailed Mutation Analysis**

Negated Conditional Mutations

Example: if (query == null) was negated.
Killed by:
sut.TestAllDuPathsCoverage.ad16
sut.TestLogicBasedCoverage.lb2
Result: All negated conditional mutations were killed.

Changed Conditional Boundaries
Example: if (c < x.c) had its boundary altered.
Killed by:
sut.TestAllDuPathsCoverage.ad5
Result: All boundary-altering mutations were killed.

Replaced Return Values
Example: Replacing the return value with "" or null.
Killed by:
sut.TestEdgePairPrimePathCoverage.ep2
Result: All return value mutations were killed.

Changed Increments
Example: Changing i++ to i--.
Killed by:
sut.TestAllDuPathsCoverage.ad16
Result: All increment mutations were killed.

**Summary**

The longestPrefixOf method achieved 100% mutation coverage across all testing criteria. This demonstrates that the test suite is comprehensive and effectively detects all introduced mutations. The high mutation coverage reflects strong test cases that cover:

All logical paths.
Edge cases.
Data flow scenarios.
Predicate logic.

This ensures the robustness and reliability of the longestPrefixOf method.
